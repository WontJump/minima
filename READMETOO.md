# Messing around: 

- added an additional variable to give the header an independent colour (no dark mode yet) 
- change the percent of the spacing in the wrapper but havent changed the spacing unit of the site 
- changed the header colour to be the background colour 
- I've added an overide so the header has no limit on its width but still has some padding in layout.scss
- added in a change of size/impact on the nav items 
- Add in pictures of the sponsors 
    - added in links on the pictures! 

- so the nav bar is now broken (its only got the about page and theres a new site title as a home page link) I think this is because the config yaml file was empty and I've entered some basic settings 
- also for some reason the header color variable wasn't working so I've just defined it within the layout scss file for a quick work around.


# Todo 

- should be more left padding on the top bar 
- Need to further clean up the comittee page and bring over the data
- make the footer better
- add a home button 
- add in links for the seminars and conference buttom
