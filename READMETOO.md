# Messing around: 

- added an additional variable to give the header an independent colour (no dark mode yet) 
- change the percent of the spacing in the wrapper but havent changed the spacing unit of the site 
- changed the header colour to be the background colour 
- I've added an overide so the header has no limit on its width but still has some padding in layout.scss
